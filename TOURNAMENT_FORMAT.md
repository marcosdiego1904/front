### Scoring System (Semi-Finals)

**Points Breakdown**:

| Metric | Points | How It's Calculated |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| **Verses Recited** | 10 points each | 1 verse = 10 pts, 5 verses = 50 pts |
| **Accuracy Bonus** | +3 points per verse | Word-perfect or 90%+ accurate |
| **Speed Bonus** | +5 points | If 5+ verses in 60 seconds |
| **Reference Accuracy** | +2 points per verse | Correct book, chapter, verse number |

**Penalties**:
| Mistake | Penalty |
|---------|---------|
| Incorrect reference | Verse doesn't count (0 points) |
| Less than 70% accurate recitation | Half points (5 instead of 10) |
| Repeated verse | 0 points for duplicate |
| Using notes/cheating | Immediate disqualification |

**Example Score**:
```
Participant recites 6 verses in 60 seconds:
- Verses recited: 6 × 10 = 60 points
- Accuracy bonus (5 were word-perfect): 5 × 3 = 15 points
- Speed bonus (6 verses = 5+ threshold): 5 points
- Reference accuracy (all 6 correct): 6 × 2 = 12 points
Total: 92 points
```

### Judging Process (Semi-Finals)

**3-Judge Panel**:
- Judge 1: You (founder)
- Judge 2: Guest judge (pastor, Bible scholar, or influencer)
- Judge 3: Guest judge (different person)

**Live Scoring**:
- Each judge has scoring sheet (Google Sheet shared screen)
- Judges mark:
  - ✅ Verse count

**Scoring** (Same as Semi-Finals but extended):

|--------|--------|-------|
| Verses Recited | 10 points each | More time = more verses possible |

- Must be 100% word-perfect
- **Bonus: +20 points** if successful

#### Option B: "Verse Chain"
- Recite 3 verses that share a common theme/word
- Example: 3 verses about "faith" or all containing the word "love"
- Must recite all 3 back-to-back in 30 seconds
- **Bonus: +25 points** if successful

#### Option C: "Audience Choice"
- Live chat votes on a verse for finalist to recite
- Finalist has 10 seconds to prepare

- **Bonus: +5 points per 10 words**
  - 25-34 words: +5 points

- Maximum points possible: +40 (15 for longest + 25 for chain)

---

### Why This Structure Works

**For Participants**:
- ✅ **Flexibility**: Choose subscription (ongoing value) OR one-time (just tournament)
- ✅ **Fair**: Both have equal chance to win (no pay-to-win advantage)
- ✅ **Clear value**: Subscription is better deal if you plan to use app long-term

**For You (Revenue)**:
- ✅ **Predictable**: Know prize pool based on entries
- ✅ **Scalable**: More entries = bigger pool (or keep $2,500 fixed, pocket extra)
- ✅ **Recurring**: Subscribers stay beyond tournament

**Revenue Math** (Conservative):
- 20 Pro subs ($9.99): $199.80
- 20 Entry fees ($15): $300
- **Total: $499.80**

**Wait, that's not enough for $2,500 in prizes!**

Let me recalculate with your 30-50 participant cap:

**Scenario 1: 30 Participants**
- 15 Pro subs: $149.85
- 15 Entry fees: $225
- **Total: $374.85** ❌ Not enough

**Scenario 2: 50 Participants**
- 25 Pro subs: $249.75
- 25 Entry fees: $375
- **Total: $624.75** ❌ Still not enough for $2,500

## 💡 SOLUTION: Adjust Prize Pool to Entry Revenue

### Smart Approach: Dynamic Prize Pool

**Prize Pool Formula**:
- **Total Revenue × 50% = Prize Pool**
- **Total Revenue × 50% = Your Cut** (platform fee, operations, profit)

**Examples**:

**30 Participants ($375 revenue)**:
- Prize pool: $187.50
- Your cut: $187.50

**50 Participants ($625 revenue)**:
- Prize pool: $312.50
- Your cut: $312.50

**100 Participants ($1,250 revenue)** - if you increase cap:
- Prize pool: $625
- Your cut: $625

---

### OR: Fixed Prize Pool with Sponsorship

**Prize Pool: $2,500 (Fixed)**

**Funded by**:
- Entry fees: ~$500-600 (from participants)
- **Sponsorship**: $1,900-2,000
  - Bible publishers (Zondervan, Thomas Nelson, Crossway)
  - Christian brands (Hobby Lobby, Chick-fil-A, Christian bookstores)
  - Churches (sponsor in exchange for promotion)

**Sponsorship Benefits**:
- Logo on tournament page
- Mention during livestream
- Social media shoutouts
- Access to email list (with permission)

**My Recommendation**: Start with **dynamic prize pool** ($500-600 from entries), THEN add sponsorship if you can secure it. Don't promise $2,500 unless you have cash in hand or confirmed sponsors.
