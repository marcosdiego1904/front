**Launch Type**: Founder's Challenge + Championship Tournament
**Timeline**: November/December 2025 → January 2026
**Location**: Pennsylvania, USA
**Status**: Planning Phase

---

## 🎯 STRATEGIC OVERVIEW

### Core Concept
A two-phase viral launch combining:
1. **Founder's 30-Day Public Challenge** (Proof of concept + audience building)
2. **New Year Championship Tournament** ($2,500-$5,000 prize pool)

### Key Objectives
- Generate 5,000-10,000 free signups
- Convert 300-500 to paying subscribers
- Create viral content (500,000+ video views)

---

## 📅 PHASE 1: FOUNDER'S 30-DAY CHALLENGE
**Dates**: December 1-30, 2025
**Goal**: Build audience + prove product works + create content library

### Main Concept
You (the founder) publicly commit to memorizing **30 Bible verses in 30 days** using your own app. If you fail, you donate your January app revenue to charity.

### Why This Works
- ✅ **Authenticity**: You're using your own product publicly
- ✅ **High stakes**: Your revenue is on the line (motivates you + creates drama)
- ✅ **Daily content**: 30 days = 30+ pieces of content automatically
- ✅ **Proof**: When you succeed, it validates your product
- ✅ **Relatability**: You'll struggle sometimes (builds connection)
- ✅ **Timing**: Ends Dec 30, perfect lead-in to New Year tournament

## 🎬 PHASE 1: CONTENT STRATEGY

### Week 1 (Dec 1-7): Controversial Hooks + Challenge Announcement

**Primary Goal**: Stop the scroll, create controversy, build awareness

#### Video 1: "Why 87% of Christians Are Spiritually Unarmed"
**Platform**: TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts
**Length**: 45-60 seconds

**Script Structure**:
```
HOOK (0-3 sec):
"You call yourself a Christian but can't quote a single Bible verse when your friend is suicidal. That's not faith—that's spiritual negligence."

BODY (3-40 sec):
- 87% of Christians can't recall Scripture when they need it
- We're fighting daily battles: anxiety, fear, temptation, doubt
- Ephesians 6:17 calls Scripture "the sword of the Spirit"
- But you can't use a weapon you don't have
- Most Christians are fighting unarmed—and losing

SOLUTION (40-50 sec):
- I built an app to fix this
- Gamified Bible memorization
- 10 minutes per verse
- Actually works (I'm about to prove it)

CTA (50-60 sec):
"Starting December 1st, I'm memorizing 30 verses in 30 days. Join me for free. Link in bio."
```

**Expected Reaction**:
- Controversy in comments ("That's harsh!" vs "This is truth!")
- High engagement (algorithm boost)
- Shares from convicted Christians
- 50,000-100,000 views

---

#### Video 2: "I'm Risking Everything on This Bold Claim"
**Platform**: All platforms
**Length**: 60-90 seconds

**Script Structure**:
```
HOOK:
"If I can't memorize 30 Bible verses in 30 days using my own app, I'm donating 100% of my January revenue to charity. Watch me succeed or go broke trying."

BODY:
- I'm the founder of Lamp to My Feet
- I built this app to make Bible memory easy
- But talk is cheap—I need to prove it works
- So I'm doing this publicly
- 30 verses, 30 days, starting tomorrow
- If I fail, every dollar I make in January goes to [charity name]

WHY THIS MATTERS:
- Most Bible memory apps are boring
- That's why nobody uses them
- I believe gamification + competition changes everything
- Time to prove it

CTA:
"Join me. Free. No credit card. Link in bio. We start December 1st."
```

**Expected Reaction**:
- Respect for transparency
- "I'll join you!" comments
- Shares ("This guy is serious")
- 100,000-200,000 views

---

#### Video 3: "The Truth About Bible Memory (That Churches Won't Tell You)"
**Platform**: All platforms
**Length**: 60-75 seconds

**Script Structure**:
```
HOOK:
"Your pastor wants you to memorize Scripture, but won't tell you this one truth..."

BODY:
- The truth? Most Bible memory methods SUCK.
- Flashcards are boring
- Repetition feels like homework
- No wonder nobody does it
- Churches guilt you: "You SHOULD memorize Scripture"
- But they don't make it FUN
- That's the secret: Make it a game, and people actually do it

THE SOLUTION:
- Ranks (like a video game)
- Leaderboards (competition)
- Challenges (social pressure)
- Celebrations (dopamine hits)
- This is how Duolingo taught 500M people languages
- Why not use it for the Bible?

CTA:
"I'm proving it works. 30 verses, 30 days, starting tomorrow. Join free."
```

**Expected Reaction**:
- Pastors commenting (some agreeing, some defending traditional methods = MORE ENGAGEMENT)
- "This is genius" comments
- Viral potential (controversial take)
- 150,000-300,000 views

## 💡 CONTINGENCY PLANS

### If You Fall Behind on Verses:
- **Transparency**: Make content about it ("I'm behind, here's why")
- **Catch-up content**: "Memorizing 3 verses today to catch up"
- **Builds relatability**: Shows you're human

### If Views Are Low Early:
- **Double down on controversial takes**: Algorithm needs strong reactions
- **Engage heavily in comments**: Reply to every comment first 24 hours
- **Cross-promote**: Ask friends to share
- **Paid boost**: $50-100 in ads to jumpstart

### If Signups Are Slow:
- **Increase CTA frequency**: Every video, every post
- **Add urgency**: "Championship registration closes in X days"
- **Offer incentive**: "First 1,000 signups get [bonus]"

### If You Actually Fail the 30-Day Challenge:
- **Honor your commitment**: Donate January revenue to charity (builds massive trust)
- **Turn it into content**: "I failed, but here's what I learned"
- **Pivot message**: "This is why we need better tools—I'm improving the app"
- **Actually increases credibility**: Shows you're honest

---

- ✅ Be authentic and vulnerable on camera
- ✅ Engage with community actively
- ✅ Stay consistent (30 days straight, no breaks)
