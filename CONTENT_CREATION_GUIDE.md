## 📅 YOUR ROADMAP (Nov 18 → Dec 1)

### **PHASE A: IDENTITY & WORKFLOW (Nov 18-21)**

#### 1. Your On-Camera Identity ✅

**Who You Are:**
- **Age**: 23-year-old guy figuring out life
- **Vibe**: Introvert who goes wild when it's time to act
- **Style**: NOT overly serious - happy, joyful, maybe jokes
- **Respect**: Reverent about God's Word, but relatable and fun
- **Language**: English is second language, you have an accent (and that's AUTHENTIC - embrace it!)

**Your Unique Angles:**
- Young founder (relatable to millennials/Gen Z)
- Not a pastor or theologian - just a regular guy
- Passionate but playful (not religious/stuffy)
- Accent = authenticity (don't hide it, own it)
- Action-oriented (doing the challenge publicly)

**On-Camera Persona Mix:**
- 60% Energetic, passionate friend sharing a journey
- 30% Vulnerable guy admitting struggles
- 10% Teacher/expert (when explaining the app)

**Tone Guide:**
- ✅ Joyful, energetic, passionate
- ✅ Genuine excitement about Scripture
- ✅ Light humor, self-deprecating jokes OK
- ✅ Conversational (talk TO camera like a friend)
- ❌ NOT preachy or religious-sounding
- ❌ NOT overly polished or scripted
- ❌ NOT ashamed of accent (it makes you unique!)

#### 2. Filming Locations

**Option 1: Kitchen**
- Natural light from window
- Clean, neutral background
- Casual, relatable setting
- **Best for**: Daily update videos, casual talks

**Option 2: Room**
- Controlled environment
- Personal space (authentic)
- Can set up permanent filming spot
- **Best for**: Longer videos, sit-down reflections

**Option 3: Backyard**
- Natural lighting (golden hour)
- Visual variety
- Energetic vibe
- **Best for**: Inspirational content, celebration videos

**Pro Tip**: Rotate locations throughout the week to keep content visually fresh!

**Location Schedule Example:**
- Monday/Wednesday/Friday: Kitchen (morning light)
- Tuesday/Thursday: Room (evening, controlled light)
- Weekend: Backyard (golden hour content)

---

### **PHASE A.2: AI PARTNER SELECTION**

#### Your AI Toolkit

**PRIMARY: ChatGPT ($20/month - GET THIS)**
- **Use for**: Daily scripts, hooks, viral content structure, caption writing
- **Why**: Best for conversational scriptwriting that matches YOUR voice
- **Daily use**: 15-30 min

**SECONDARY: Claude Pro (KEEP IT - you already have it)**
- **Use for**: Weekly content strategy review, analyzing performance, long-form blog posts
- **Why**: Better for deep thinking, pattern analysis, strategic pivots
- **Weekly use**: 1-2 hours on Sundays

**CREATIVE: Gemini Pro (you have it)**
- **Use for**: Image generation ideas, YouTube descriptions, visual concepts
- **Why**: Good for creative brainstorming, visual storytelling
- **As needed**: 30 min weekly

**SKIP FOR NOW**: Kimi 2, GLM, Grok
- You don't need 6 AI tools
- Master 2-3 first, expand later if needed

**Your AI Workflow:**
```
ChatGPT = Daily content partner (scripts, hooks, captions)
Claude = Weekly strategist (review, adjust, deep thinking)
Gemini = Creative support (visuals, long-form)
```

---

### **PHASE A.3: TIME BUDGET & CONTENT VOLUME**

#### Weekly Time Investment: 15 hours (2+ hours/day)

**Daily Breakdown (2 hours):**
- **AI prep (scripts, planning)**: 15 min
- **Filming**: 30-45 min (multiple takes, setups)
- **Editing**: 45-60 min (CapCut on iPhone)
- **Posting + engagement**: 20-30 min

#### Content Output (Dec 1-30)

**Daily Content:**
- Morning short video (TikTok/Instagram/YouTube Shorts): 30-60 sec
- Evening story update (Instagram Stories): 15 sec

**Weekly Content:**
- Long-form video (YouTube): 5-8 min
- **Total**: ~10-12 pieces of content per week

**Quality over Quantity**: Better to post 1 great video than 3 mediocre ones.

#### Pre-Launch Content (Nov 18-30)

**Week 1 (Nov 18-24): LEARN + TEST**
- No posting yet
- Focus: Learning tools, testing camera, practicing scripts
- Output: 3-5 test videos (for practice, not posting)

**Week 2 (Nov 25-30): CREATE BUFFER**
- Film 5-7 videos to have ready for Dec 1-7
- Edit and schedule them
- Test posting on platforms (maybe 1-2 teasers)

---

## 🎬 PHASE B: TECHNICAL SETUP (Nov 22-24)

### iPhone 16 Video Settings

**Camera App Settings:**
- **Resolution**: 1080p at 60fps (best for TikTok/Instagram)
- **Format**: Most Compatible (not High Efficiency)
- **Grid**: ON (helps with rule of thirds composition)
- **Cinematic Mode**: OFF (use standard video unless doing creative effects)
- **Front vs Back Camera**: Front camera for authenticity (talking to viewers)

**Composition Tips:**
- Keep your face in upper 2/3 of frame (leave room for text at bottom)
- Eye level with camera (not looking down or up)
- Arm's length distance (not too close, not too far)

### Lighting Strategy

**Best Free Option: Natural Window Light**
- Film FACING the window (you're lit from front)
- Avoid having window BEHIND you (creates silhouette)
- Best times: 8-10am (soft morning light) or 4-6pm (golden hour)

**Cloudy Days**: Actually BETTER than harsh sun (soft, even lighting)

**Night/Indoor**:
- Turn on all room lights
- Film near lamps
- Consider: $15-25 ring light from Amazon (optional but helpful)

**Lighting Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Overhead lights only (creates shadows under eyes)
- Backlighting (window behind you)
- Mixed color temps (warm + cool lights together)

### Audio Quality

**iPhone 16 Built-in Mic**: Actually pretty good!

**Audio Tips:**
- Film in quiet room
- Turn off AC, fans, TV
- Avoid echo-y rooms (bathrooms, empty rooms)
- Speak clearly and project voice

**Optional Upgrade ($20-30):**
- Lavalier (lapel) mic that plugs into iPhone
- Clips to shirt, captures clear voice
- Brands: Rode, Boya, PowerDeWise
- **Game changer for quality**

### Equipment Checklist

**MUST HAVE:**
- ✅ iPhone 16 (you have it)
- ✅ Phone tripod/stand ($15-25 on Amazon)

**NICE TO HAVE:**
- 🟡 Lavalier mic ($20-30)
- 🟡 Ring light ($15-25)
- 🟡 Backdrop/clean wall (free - just tidy up background)

**DON'T NEED (Yet):**
- ❌ Professional camera
- ❌ Studio lights
- ❌ Green screen
- ❌ Fancy editing software

**Total Investment**: $15-50 (very affordable start)

### Example Prompt for YOUR First Video

## 💪 MINDSET & MOTIVATION

### Your Biggest Strengths

**Accent = Authenticity**: Don't hide it. It makes you UNIQUE. People connect with real, not perfect.

**Introvert Who Acts**: This is POWERFUL. People will relate to your vulnerability AND respect your courage.

**Young Founder**: 23 is an asset, not a liability. You represent the next generation of Christians.

**Joyful Approach**: This differentiates you from "serious" Christian content. Joy is contagious.

### Overcoming Fear

**Fear: "My English isn't perfect"**
- **Truth**: Authenticity > Perfection. Your accent makes you memorable.
- **Action**: Speak clearly, but don't stress about accent.

**Fear: "I'm not a pastor/theologian"**
- **Truth**: That's your STRENGTH. You're a regular guy, which is relatable.
- **Action**: Lead with "I'm not a pastor, I'm just a guy who..."

**Fear: "What if I mess up on camera?"**
- **Truth**: You will. And that's OK. Edit it out or leave it in (shows you're human).
- **Action**: Film 3-5 takes. Pick the best. Don't aim for perfection.

**Fear: "What if nobody watches?"**
- **Truth**: Week 1 might be slow. That's normal. Keep going.
- **Action**: Focus on consistency, not virality. 30 days of showing up builds trust.

### Daily Affirmations (Before Filming)

1. "I'm doing this to help people, not to be perfect."
2. "My accent makes me unique and authentic."
3. "I don't need to be a pastor to share my journey."
4. "Consistency matters more than perfection."
5. "God's Word is powerful, my job is just to share it."
