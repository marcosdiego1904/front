# Social Media for Absolute Beginners - 30-Day Challenge Guide
**For**: Founders with ZERO social media experience
**Timeline**: 17 days to prepare (Nov 15 - Dec 1)
**Goal**: Be ready to post daily videos starting Dec 1

---

## 🎯 YOU ONLY NEED 3 PLATFORMS

Forget everything else. You only need:
1. **TikTok** - Short videos (30-60 sec) - MAIN platform
2. **Instagram** - Same videos as TikTok (cross-post)
3. **YouTube** - Longer videos (5-10 min) once per week

That's it. No Twitter, no Facebook groups, no LinkedIn (yet).

---

## 📱 WEEK 1: SETUP (Nov 15-22)

### DAY 1-2: Create Your Accounts

#### TikTok Setup (30 minutes):
1. Download TikTok app on your phone
2. Sign up with email (not Facebook/Google - easier to manage)
3. Choose username: **@lamptomyfeet** (or **@lamptomyfeetapp**)
4. Profile setup:
   - **Name**: "Lamp to My Feet"
   - **Bio**:

2. Sign up with SAME email as TikTok
3. Username: **@lamptomyfeet** (match TikTok exactly)
4. Profile setup:
   - **Name**: "Lamp to My Feet"

   - **Link**: lamptomyfeet.co

5. Enable monetization (for future):
   - YouTube Studio → Monetization → Apply
   - You won't make money immediately, but start the process

---

### DAY 3-4: Learn the Basics (What Makes Videos Go Viral)

#### The 3-Second Rule:
**If you don't hook them in 3 seconds, they scroll.**

**BAD hook**: "Hey guys, welcome back to my channel..."
**GOOD hook**: "You call yourself a Christian but can't quote a single verse when your friend is suicidal."

**Why it works**: Shock + truth + challenge = they keep watching.

---

#### Video Structure (for 30-60 sec videos):
```
Seconds 0-3:   HOOK (shocking statement, question, or bold claim)
Seconds 3-15:  PROBLEM (paint the pain, make them feel it)
Seconds 15-40: SOLUTION (your app, your challenge, what you're doing)
Seconds 40-60: CTA (call to action - "Join me, link in bio")
```

**Example**:
- 0-3: "87% of Christians can't quote Scripture when they need it most."
- 3-15: "You're fighting anxiety, fear, temptation every day—UNARMED."
- 15-40: "I'm changing that. 30 verses in 30 days. Proving memorization works."
- 40-60: "Join me. Free. Link in bio. We start Dec 1."

---

#### What Gets Views on TikTok/Instagram:
✅ **Controversy** ("Most Christians are spiritually lazy")
✅ **Vulnerability** (showing you struggle/fail)
✅ **Before/After** (transformations)
✅ **Challenges** (30-day challenge format)
✅ **Faces** (people want to see YOU, not just text)
✅ **Raw/Authentic** (don't over-edit, scrappy is fine)

❌ **What DOESN'T work**:
❌ Polished, corporate videos
❌ Talking too slow (you have 3 seconds!)
❌ No face on camera
❌ "Welcome to my channel" intros
❌ Boring thumbnails

---

### DAY 5-7: Equipment & Filming Setup

#### You Need (Total cost: $0-$50):

**Option A - Completely Free**:
- ✅ Your phone (iPhone or Android)
- ✅ Natural window light (film near a window during daytime)
- ✅ Lean phone against books/boxes to film

**Option B - Upgrade ($50)**:
- ✅ Phone tripod with remote ($15 on Amazon)
- ✅ Clip-on phone ring light ($20 on Amazon)
- ✅ Lavalier mic ($15 - clips to shirt)
- **Total: $50**

**My recommendation**: Start with Option A (free). If you get 1,000 followers in Week 1, buy Option B.

---

#### Best Filming Setup (FREE):

**Location**: Film in the same spot every day (consistency)
- Near a window (natural light)
- Clean background (not messy room)
- Quiet (no TV, dogs barking, etc.)

**Lighting**:
- Film during daytime (10am-3pm = best natural light)
- Face the window (light on your face, not behind you)
- If nighttime: Turn on all lights in room + one lamp pointed at ceiling (bounces light)

**Camera Position**:
- Phone at EYE LEVEL (not looking up at you, not looking down)
- Arm's length away (not too close, not too far)
- VERTICAL (9:16 ratio - TikTok/Instagram format)

**Audio**:
- Speak LOUD and CLEAR
- Get close to phone (2-3 feet max)
- Turn off AC/fans (background noise kills videos)

---

## 📱 WEEK 2: PRACTICE (Nov 23-30)

### DAY 8-10: Download CapCut & Learn Editing (1 hour total)

#### What is CapCut?
FREE video editing app (owned by TikTok). Easiest editor for beginners.

**Download**:
- iPhone: App Store → Search "CapCut"
- Android: Play Store → Search "CapCut"

---

#### CapCut Basics (10-minute tutorial):

**Step 1**: Import video

- Select video from your phone
- Tap "Add"

**Step 2**: Trim video (remove bad parts)
- Drag white bars at start/end to trim
- Cut out mistakes: Tap video → Split → Delete bad section

**Step 3**: Add captions (AUTO CAPTIONS - game changer):

- Change font/color if you want (optional)

**Step 4**: Add music (optional):
- Tap "Audio" → "Sounds"

- Lower volume to 20% (your voice should be louder)

**Step 5**: Export
- Tap "Export" (top right)

**DONE. That's it.** Seriously, 90% of viral TikToks use these 5 steps.

---

### DAY 11-14: Film 3 Practice Videos (Don't Post Yet)

**Practice Video 1**: "Why I'm Doing This"
- Hook: "I built an app but I've never proven it works. So I'm risking everything."
- Talk about your 30-day challenge
- Film, edit in CapCut, but DON'T post
- Watch it back. What feels awkward? Redo it.

**Practice Video 2**: "The Problem"
- Hook: "87% of Christians can't quote Scripture when they need it."
- Talk about spiritual unpreparedness
- Film, edit, watch back
- Notice: Are you making eye contact with camera? Are you speaking clearly?

**Practice Video 3**: "The Invitation"
- Hook: "Join me. 30 verses in 30 days. Free."
- Explain how they can join
- Film, edit, watch back

**Goal**: Get comfortable on camera. Your first 3 videos will feel WEIRD. That's normal.

---

### DAY 15-17 (Nov 28-30): Film Your REAL Dec 1-3 Videos

**Pre-film these 3 videos so Dec 1 is smooth**:

**Video 1 (Dec 1)**: "Day 1 - It Begins"
**Video 2 (Dec 2)**: "Day 2 - My First Verse"
**Video 3 (Dec 3)**: "Day 3 - This Is Harder Than I Thought"

Edit them. Save them. Schedule them (I'll show you how below).

**Why pre-film?**
- Dec 1 will be stressful (launch day!)
- Having 3 videos ready = safety buffer
- You can focus on responding to comments instead of filming

---

## 📝 CAPTION TEMPLATES (Copy/Paste These)

### Template 1: Stat Hook
```
87% of Christians can't quote a single verse when they need it.

That changes today. Day 1 of my 30-verse challenge.

Join me (free) 👉 link in bio

#BibleMemory #ChristianTikTok #30DayChallenge #Faith #Scripture
```

### Template 2: Vulnerable Hook
```
I built a Bible memorization app but I've never proven it works publicly.

So I'm risking my reputation. 30 verses in 30 days.

If I fail, I donate my revenue to charity.

Day 1. Let's go.

#BibleChallenge #Faith #ChristianLife #MemoryChallenge
```

### Template 3: Challenge Hook
```
Most Christians read the Bible but don't KNOW the Bible.

I'm fixing that. One verse per day for 30 days.

Are you in? Link in bio.

#BibleMemory #ChristianGrowth #Scripture #Challenge #Faith
```

### Template 4: Pain Point Hook
```
You're facing anxiety, fear, and temptation every day.

But you can't quote a single verse to fight back.

That's why I'm doing this challenge. Join me.

#ChristianTikTok #BibleMemory #Faith #SpiritualGrowth
```

---

## #️⃣ HASHTAG STRATEGY

**Use 3-5 hashtags per post** (TikTok/Instagram both allow up to 30, but less is more)

### Your Core Hashtags (Use these EVERY time):
- #BibleMemory
- #ChristianTikTok (or #ChristianReels on Instagram)
- #30DayChallenge
- #Faith
- #Scripture

### Rotate These (Use 1-2 per post):
- #ChristianLife
- #BibleStudy
- #MemoryChallenge
- #SpiritualGrowth
- #ChristianMotivation
- #BibleVerses
- #FaithJourney
- #ChristianContent

**Why small hashtags work better**:
- #ChristianTikTok = 500K posts (you can rank)
- #Christian = 50M posts (you'll get buried)

---

## ⏰ BEST TIMES TO POST

### TikTok:
- **Best**: 6-9am EST (people scroll before work)
- **Good**: 7-10pm EST (people scroll before bed)
- **Worst**: 12-3pm EST (people at work/lunch)

### Instagram Reels:
- **Best**: 7-9am EST
- **Good**: 11am-1pm EST (lunch break)
- **Good**: 7-9pm EST

**Your schedule**:
- Film in morning (9-10am)
- Post at 11am EST (catches lunch crowd)
- Check comments at 1pm, 6pm, 9pm

## 🎥 YOUR FIRST 7 VIDEO SCRIPTS (Dec 1-7)

I'll write these out EXACTLY for you:

### Day 1 (Dec 1): "The Challenge Begins"

**Video Script**:
```
[Look at camera, serious face]

"I built a Bible memorization app. But I've never proven it works publicly.

[Pause]

So today I'm starting a 30-day challenge. 30 Bible verses in 30 days.

If I fail, I donate 100% of my January revenue to charity.

[Show your phone with the app]

This is Day 1. John 3:16. Let's see if I can actually do this.

[Quick cut to you reciting John 3:16]

Join me. Free. Link in bio."
```

**Caption**:
```
Day 1/30: Putting my money where my mouth is.

30 verses in 30 days or I donate my revenue to charity.

```

---

### Day 2 (Dec 2): "First Verse Down"

**Video Script**:
```
[Excited energy]

"Day 2. I actually remembered John 3:16 this morning without looking.

[Show genuine surprise]

I thought I'd forget it overnight, but it stuck!

[Quick demonstration - recite it on camera]

That's the thing nobody tells you about Bible memory: Your brain WANTS to remember meaningful things.

You just need the right system.

Day 2 verse: Philippians 4:13. Let's go.

Link in bio to join me."
```

**Caption**:
```
Day 2/30: IT ACTUALLY WORKS.

Woke up and remembered yesterday's verse perfectly.

If my brain can do this, yours can too.

```

---

### Day 3 (Dec 3): "The Struggle"

**Video Script**:
```
[Frustrated face]

"Okay, Day 3 was ROUGH.

[Show yourself looking at phone]

Philippians 4:13 has way more words than I thought.

'I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.'

Simple, right? I forgot it 5 times today.

[Quick cut to you messing up]

This is why 87% of Christians don't memorize Scripture. It's HARD.

But hard doesn't mean impossible.

Day 3: Still going. 27 more to go.

Link in bio if you want to struggle with me."
```

**Caption**:
```
Day 3/30: This is harder than I expected.

But I'm not quitting.

Real talk: Bible memory is WORK. But it's worth it.

### Day 4 (Dec 4): "Why This Matters"

**Video Script**:
```
[Serious tone]

"Someone asked me: 'Why do this? Just read the Bible when you need it.'

Here's why.

[Look directly at camera]

When your friend calls you at 2am because they're thinking about suicide...

You don't have time to Google 'Bible verses about hope.'

When you're alone with temptation and your phone is in the other room...

You need Scripture IN YOUR HEART.

That's why I'm doing this.

Day 4: Romans 8:28.

Join me. Link in bio."
```

**Caption**:
```
Day 4/30: Why memorization matters.

You can't Google verses when you're in the battle.

You need them in your heart NOW.

#BibleMemory #ChristianTikTok #Faith #SpiritualWarfare
```

---

### Day 5 (Dec 5): "The Method"

**Video Script**:
```
[Teaching tone]

"People ask: How are you memorizing so fast?

I'll show you. It's 3 steps.

[Show on fingers]

Step 1: BREAK IT DOWN.
Romans 8:28 = 'And we know' / 'that in all things' / 'God works for the good' / 'of those who love him.'

Step 2: REPEAT each chunk 5 times out loud.

Step 3: TEST yourself without looking.

[Quick demonstration]

That's it. No gimmicks.

Day 5: Done. This method works.

Try it yourself. Link in bio."
```

**Caption**:
```
Day 5/30: My 3-step memorization method.

Break it down. Repeat it. Test yourself.

Works every time.

### Day 6 (Dec 6): "The Emotional Hook"

**Video Script**:
```
[Vulnerable moment]

"Day 6. Something unexpected happened.

I was stressed yesterday—work stuff, life stuff.

And Romans 8:28 just... popped into my head.

'All things work together for good for those who love God.'

I didn't try to remember it. It was just there.

[Pause, let that sit]

That's the point. When you memorize Scripture, it's THERE when you need it.

Not when it's convenient. When you NEED it.

Day 6: Psalm 23:1.

Join me. Link in bio."
```

**Caption**:
```
Day 6/30: It's working.

Scripture I memorized showed up EXACTLY when I needed it.

This is why we do this.

4. Psalm 23:1

## 💡 PRO TIPS (Steal These)

### Tip 1: Show Your Face
People connect with FACES, not logos. Every video should show YOU talking to camera.

### Tip 2: First Draft = Posted Draft
Don't over-edit. Scrappy, authentic videos outperform polished ones. Film it, caption it, post it. Move on.

### Tip 3: Reply to Every Comment (First 24 Hours)
TikTok's algorithm rewards engagement. If you reply to comments, TikTok shows your video to more people.

### Tip 4: Steal What Works
Watch videos in #BibleMemory and #ChristianTikTok. If a video has 100K+ views, study it:
- What was the hook?
- How long was the video?
- What did they say in caption?
- Copy the structure (not the words)

### Tip 5: Post at the SAME TIME Every Day
Consistency trains your audience. If you post at 11am daily, they'll check TikTok at 11am looking for you.

### Tip 6: Don't Check Views Obsessively
Your first 10 videos might get 100-500 views each. That's NORMAL. One video will pop (10K+ views), then the algorithm will push your others.

---

## ❓ FAQ: "But I'm Not Good at This..."

**Q: I'm awkward on camera. Help.**
A: Everyone is awkward at first. Film 10 practice videos. Delete them. By video 11, you'll be comfortable. Also: Awkward = relatable. Polished = boring.

**Q: What if nobody watches my videos?**
A: Your first 10 videos will get low views. Post anyway. Video #11 might explode. You never know which one the algorithm will love.

**Q: What if people leave mean comments?**
A: They will. Ignore trolls. Reply to genuine criticism. Delete/block hate speech. Thick skin required.

**Q: Do I need to show my face?**
A: YES. Faceless videos get 10x fewer views. People follow PEOPLE, not brands.

**Q: Can I hire someone to do this for me?**
A: No. The whole point is YOU doing the challenge. Outsourcing kills authenticity.

**Q: What if I mess up and forget a verse?**
A: PERFECT. Film it. "Day 15: I completely blanked on this verse. This is why we practice." = Viral content.
